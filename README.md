# CaliforniaHousePricePrediction
This GitHub project is a comprehensive data science and machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices in California. The project uses the California Housing dataset and employs various machine learning techniques to build predictive models.
# California House Price Prediction

# Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and prediction of house prices in California using various machine learning techniques. Housing price prediction is a crucial task for both homebuyers and sellers, and this project aims to demonstrate how to build and evaluate predictive models for this purpose.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: The project begins by loading the California Housing dataset and converting it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extensive exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the dataset, including data distribution, correlations, and missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Data patterns and relationships are visualized using various plots, including joint plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
- **Model Building**: Two different machine learning models, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor, are implemented and trained to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models' performance is assessed using the R-squared (R2) score and mean absolute error (MAE).
- **Visualization**: The project includes visualizations comparing actual vs. predicted house prices.
